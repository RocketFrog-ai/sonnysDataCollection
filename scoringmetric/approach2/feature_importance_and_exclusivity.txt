FEATURE IMPORTANCE & MUTUAL EXCLUSIVITY (Approach 2)
================================================================================
Reference: output.txt (19 features, percentile-based 0–100 scores)
Config: app/scoring/feature_weights_config.py

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. FEATURE IMPORTANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• What “importance” means here
  - Each feature gets a 0–100 score from its percentile rank (and direction).
  - Importance = how much that feature’s score affects (a) the dimension score
    and (b) the overall site score.

• Dimension level (DIMENSION_FEATURE_WEIGHTS)
  - Weights sum to 1 within each dimension.
  - Dimension score = weighted average of that dimension’s feature scores.
  - Example (Gas): distance 50%, rating 20%, rating_count 30% → distance
    has the largest impact on the Gas dimension.

• Overall level (FEATURE_WEIGHTS)
  - One weight per feature across all 19 features (derived from category
    weight × feature weight within category in the mapping sheet).
  - Overall site score = weighted average of all 19 feature scores.
  - Highest overall weights (e.g. competition count, competitor distance,
    Costco distance) have the most impact on the single overall number.

• In output.txt
  - “Overall Score: 53.26/100” is (by default) the average of all 19
    feature scores. If FEATURE_WEIGHTS is used, it’s the weighted
    average instead.
  - “Top 10 strengths” / “Top 10 weaknesses” are by each feature’s
    score; importance is reflected when aggregating to dimension or
    overall, not in that ranking itself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. MUTUAL EXCLUSIVITY OF FEATURES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• Features are NOT mutually exclusive (statistically)
  - Different features often measure related things, so they can be
    correlated. Examples:
    - Weather: precipitation vs rainy_days; sunshine vs pleasant_days.
    - Retail: distance to Costco vs Walmart vs Target (all “retail
      proximity” but different anchors).
    - Competition: competitors_count_4miles vs competitor_1_distance_miles
      (more competitors often means a nearer first competitor).
  - So one underlying factor (e.g. “lots of retail”) can push several
    feature scores up or down together. The model does not assume
    independence.

• Mutual exclusivity in a different sense (no double-counting of inputs)
  - Each feature is a distinct measurement: one value per feature per
    site (e.g. one distance to nearest gas, one competitor count, one
    precipitation value).
  - The same raw input is not fed twice under two feature names. So at
    the input level we don’t double-count; at the statistical level we
    do have overlap in what drives multiple features.

• Why it matters
  - Weighted sums (dimension / overall) can over-emphasize a single
    underlying driver if many correlated features get high weight (e.g.
    several retail-distance features). That’s a design choice, not an
    assumption of independence.
  - For interpretation: strong “Retail” may mean several retail features
    are good together; they’re not independent evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. BRIEF SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• Importance: Controlled by DIMENSION_FEATURE_WEIGHTS (within dimension)
  and FEATURE_WEIGHTS (overall). Higher weight ⇒ larger effect on
  dimension or overall score.

• Mutual exclusivity: Features are not mutually exclusive—they can be
  correlated. Each feature is a separate measurement (no double-counting
  of the same input), but the same underlying factor can affect multiple
  features at once.
